Hello, my name in Andrzej, I am a JavaScript Developer currently working on web-based augmented reality experiences.

I am an architect turned software engineer - which isn't as odd as it sounds, considering I find many similarities between the two fields in my day-to-day work.

As I am currently focused on expanding my knowledge of TypeScript, I am looking forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences here. 

Cheers.
